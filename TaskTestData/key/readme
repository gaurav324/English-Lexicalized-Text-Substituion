contents of the tar file :-

gold: the gold_file for the best and oot tasks

mwgold: the gold_file for the multiword task

MRsamples: a list of the words (with part of speech) where sentence
selection was performed manually. Used by scoreFA.pl for the "further
analysis" results.

mwids: a list of ids identified as multiwords by having a majority
vote by 2 or more annotators for the same multiword (lemmatised
phrase). Used by scoreFA.pl for the "further analysis" results.

readme : this file

score.pl: the scorer. This should be run as described in section 3 of
the document that was released with the trial run data and is also
available at
http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/task10/task10documentation.pdf

scoreFA.pl: A copy of score.pl but with comments taken out so that the
further analysis on NMWT, NMWS, RAND and MAN subsets will be
performed.
* NMWT only do ids where the target word has not been identified as a
multiword, i.e. the id does not appear in the mwids file
* NMWS only using single word substitutes from the gold standard
* MAN only score using words from the MAN sample, that is words where
the test sentences were selected manually
* RAND only score using words from the RAND sample, that is words
where the test sentences were selected randomly

NB run scoreFA.pl from the directory where you have stored the files
mwids and MRsamples

----------------------------------
Changes to scorer from trial release (8 Jan 2007)

any hyphens changed to spaces to allow conformity between annotators,
and annotators and systems

"non" + space (or hyphen) is conjoined to the following word
e.g. non-alcoholic or non alcoholic -> nonalcoholic

American -> British spelling mapping for some substitutes in the gold
standard

added fix to ensure "pn" (proper name) items are not used for scoring

fixed oot measure to enforce that a maximum of 10 items are used. If
there are more in the system file then the extra are discarded
