This release contains 
i) the input lexsub_test.xml file 
ii) an updated version of the lexsub.dtd 
iii) this readme.

For information on format and scoring, please refer to the task
documentation delivered with the trial run data and available from
http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/task10/task10documentation.pdf.
Section 2 of that document has information on format of the test data
(subsection 2.1) and system answer files (subsection 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4)
and section 4 has details on how the systems will be scored.

Please note that the scorer is being amended to:- 

i) only use the first ten substitutes in the "oot" answer file. This
restriction was overlooked in the trial run version which relied on
systems enforcing the limit of 10 substitutes.

ii) provide "best" and "oot" scores for a) all responses (as in trial run)
and b) for items where a multiword was NOT detected. As with the trial
run, an item is considered as a multiword if at least two annotators
identified the target as "an integral part of a phrase" and the
lemmatised phrases were the same.

Your results need to be uploaded in a single tarball. Please use tar
and gzip, or zip to create the tarball. Your tarball should contain up
to 3 files with extensions .best .oot .mw respectively. These will
denote which scoring is to be conducted on the file (see
task10documentation.pdf) and should conform to the formats specified
in the respective subsections 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of that
document. You can enter your system for any subset of the best, oot
and mw evaluations in which case just supply the relevant subset of
files. If you wish to submit more than one system please contact us at
lexsub@sussex.ac.uk (in accordance with the SEMEVAL rules for
participants
http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/participants.shtml#rules) and use
file extensions .best2 .oot2 .mw2 for your second system.

thank you for your interest in this task, and good luck!
